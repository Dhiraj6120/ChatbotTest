Hello! How can I help you today?

I want to test the browser

#bot
I understand you want to test the browser. This is a test conversation to verify that the Chrome browser is launching and visible during Botium testing.

#me
Can you confirm the browser is working?

#bot
Yes, if you can see this conversation happening in a Chrome browser window, then the browser automation is working correctly with Botium!

#me
